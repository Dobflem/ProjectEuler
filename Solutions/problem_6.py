# Sum square difference - Problem 6
#
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#     (1 ** 2) + (2 ** 2) + ... + (10 ** 2) = 385
#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#     (1 + 2 + ... + 10) ** 2 = 55 ** 2 = 3025
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
#     3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum
